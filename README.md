# Accord - choices just got a lot more fun

**What is Accord?**

Accord was inspired by our team's inability to choose where to get dinner after class. We didn't like relying on a single person in the group to decide, nor were we able to all come to a unified decision after everyone's ideas were on the table. Taking some additional inspiration from the popular quiz app Kahoot, we decided to go with a similar approach and applied it to make decisions. Accord takes suggestions provided by users and throws them into a tournament-style bracket, in which all the choices face-off against each other in a 1-on-1 battle until there's only 1 suggestion standing. It provides an organized and structured way to make decisions while keeping the process quick, easy, and most importantly, fun.

## End Users

End users of our app will be anyone who needs to make a choice within a group setting. Accord makes it easy to go from a bunch of choices to one clear winner, making group choices quick and painless.

The app is intended to provide a clean and seamless interface for users which minimizes potential roadblocks when making a decision. This is made possible by a snappy room-based architecture, allowing for a painless joining experience for users. Finally, the fast-paced decision 'tournament' combined with anonymous voting means choices don't take long to make and you can actually vote for what you really want - no fear of being judged by your friends.
