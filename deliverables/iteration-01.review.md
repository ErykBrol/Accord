## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 13 2017
 * Where: BA3195

## Process - Reflection


 -Group meetings are productive, and everybody shows up, so we will keep as it is.

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Friday meeting days
	* Everybody is able to show up, so we can actually collaborate as a team.
 * Collaborating on Google docs to get our Deliverable 1 complete
 	* We were all able to edit the document at the time, so we were able to get it done faster.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Facebook messenger.
	* We thought it would be a good idea at the start since everybody had Facebook already, but it quickly became unorganized
* After tutorial meeting times
	* Our tutorials end at 9pm, so everyone is tired, and the meeting is unproductive.

#### Planned changes

* Facebook messenger is getting unorganized, so we’re moving to Slack.
* Trying out Trello for our iterations/planning, for organized planning.
* Adding a quick online meeting midweek (Tuesdays) just there to provide a quick status update on everyone.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Decided on the problem space we wanted to target.
* Decided on our product.
* Decided on product details (how we are going to achieve the goal of our product).
* Drew a preliminary mockup, and a digital prototype of our product.
* Decided the team roles.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Tech stack still not finalized but the team is leaning towards React Native for mobile app and Java+Spring for backend services.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
* Divide work on Trello board
	* Have different sections for the frontend and backend 
* Document what needs to be finished and have a “priority queue” type system in place for tasks
* Having two weekly meetings (one online and one in person) to help coordinate devevlopment and improve communication.
