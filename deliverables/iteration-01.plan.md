# Accord

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: September 29, 2017
 * End date: October 13, 2017

## Process

 - We come together at our meetings (Fridays), discuss ideas/plans and solve any issues came up as a group.
 - Quick online review meetings midweek (Tuesdays), to bring us up to speed on how we’re doing and our progress.

#### Roles & responsibilities

For the development aspect of this project, our team is divided into two groups:

Backend Engineering Team :
- Yoson
- Bilal
- Jesse

Mobile Engineering Team:
- Rebecca
- Vincent
- Lucas
- Eryk

We may break down each team further by features. For example, there could be a backend and front end engineer working on the polling part of the application.

#### Events

##### Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

##### When and where? In-person or online?
The plan is to meet in person at Bahen room 3195 every Friday at 5pm. Meetings typically last from 90 to 120 minutes. Other minor decisions are communicated through facebook group chat.
##### What's the purpose of each meeting?
Review the progress of the current week, discuss any difficulties that we encounter, and set a progress goal for the next weekly meeting.

#### Artifacts

* Trello boards
	* Helps organize and plan our iterations, and centralizes our information
	* General tasks will be assigned from group meetings, which will be uploaded in Trello board’s check up list. For specific tasks, like individual’s time schedule, those tasks will be uploaded privately. If a task has been done, a member will give a checkmark to the task to notify the team members. 
	* We are going to prioritize tasks by each member give a point to each tasks and task that got the most point will be considered most important.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

* Decide on the problem space we want to target
	* Discuss problems we encounter recently and think of possible solutions
* Decide on the idea
	* Suggest ideas to solve the problem and vote on the ones that we like best
* Decide how we are going to implement the idea
	* Once we choose our idea, we will discuss possible implementations (mobile vs desktop vs web?)
* Draw a mockup
	* Sketch how we want the app to look like
* Create a prototype
	* Using Invision, turn our sketches into a prototype to be used for planning
* Decide on a tech stack (not as important right now)
	* Find out what programming languages each team member is confortable with

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

* Whiteboard mockups / ideas
	* Helps realize our ideas
* Meeting notes
