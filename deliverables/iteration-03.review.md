## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Dec 01, 2017
 * Where: BA 3195

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* The choice to release at the end of the iteration worked out well, it kept the pressure of constantly releasing low and ensured a coherent end-product.

* Our Slack and Github process worked well, much like in our last iteration
	* Github process ensured that broken code was never released. (Please see last iteration documents)
	* Slack allowed communication between team members in organized channels, and kept team members updated with its Github integration. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Trello changes from the iteration plan didn’t work out as well as planned.
	* The rules we set out for updating Trello were not followed closely.
	* Cards were not being moved to the corresponding sections (planned->in progress, in progress->in review), and were not being commented on to keep track of who was working on it.

 * One week sprint was not as productive and orderly as we had hoped, with the added pressure of end-of-semester assignments and tests from other courses.


#### Planned changes

 * We feel comfortable with our current process and given how short the next iteration is we won’t be making any process-related changes.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Suggestions
  * Idea submission screen will display suggestions relating to the room topic (only works for popular topics i.e. food)
* Front-end 
	* Google API functionality
  * Preventing users from navigating screens incorrectly
  * Authenticate room codes (only allow joining existing rooms)
  * Ensuring values entered for topics/time limit are error checked
  * Changing room codes to be more readable
* Back-end
	* Support for suggestions based on past user submissions for specific room topics.
	* Various error checking additions regarding communication with clients
	* Generated room codes are now in all caps to ensure readability on client end.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Results info card
  * Top result for popular topics (i.e. food) will be displayed in informative card with link to Google Maps
  * Instead of going with a full results info card we changed our mind and went with a redirect to Google Maps instead to display this info, due to time constraints.
  * Embedding Maps within the app turned out to be more work than we thought, so we decided to offload this functionality to the actual Google Maps/Places app.

* UI/UX
  * Re-design the voting screen and the results screen
  * We attempted to include animations to the voting screen buttons, however we 
couldn’t achieve a functional implementation that worked with the rest of our code with the time constraint.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * How to sell/present our product at the demo in a complete and coherent way.
 * Try and implement/expand on what we couldn’t finish in this iteration before the demo.
